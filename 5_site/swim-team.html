            The View Ridge Swim Team is open to all children ages five to high school graduation who are members of the club.  At View Ridge we value inclusion, teamwork, sportsmanship, and fun.  We hope to see all swimmers grow in and out of the pool, and encourage everyone to be lifelong swimmers.  The coaches strive to create strong relationships with all swimmers and encourage them to do the same with their teammates.

            View Ridge is a member of the Greater Seattle Summer Swim League which is comprised of 16 teams divided evenly into North and South Divisions.  The GSSSL has been in existence since 1960 to promote recreational and competitive swimming.
